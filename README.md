## 🔧 Firebase Setup (Optional)
If you want all guests to see each other’s posts (not just local storage):

1. Create a Firebase project.  
2. Enable **Firestore Database (production)**, **Storage**, and **Anonymous Authentication**.  
3. Copy your Firebase config JSON from **Project Settings → Web app**.  
4. Paste it into the Admin box on the page → click **Save & Reload**.  
5. The mode will change to **Shared (Firebase)** and posts sync in real time.
