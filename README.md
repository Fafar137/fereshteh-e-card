## 🔧 Shared Mode (Optional, via Firebase)
By default the card works in **local demo** mode (messages only show on your device).  
To make it a shared guestbook:

1. Create a free Firebase project.  
2. Enable **Firestore Database** (production), **Storage**, and **Anonymous Authentication**.  
3. Copy your Firebase config (Project settings → Web app).  
4. Paste it into the “Admin → Firebase Settings” box on the page.  
5. Reload → the mode changes to **Shared (Firebase)** and everyone’s posts sync in real-time.
